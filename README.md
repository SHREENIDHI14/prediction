# PREDICTION
As a part of first question i have predicted the house price using the first data set.
Dependent Variable: House price of unit area
Type: Continuous
And used regression here
Then found out that House Age, Distance from metro, number of convenience store, lat, long are the most influencing factors on pricing.
The model didn't perform well probably due to inter-correlation between independent variables
SVR doesn't perform well, the next model would randomforest regression, which is an ensemble model
#Normalisation boosted scores to 85.23% using random forest

#SIMILARITY
As a part of question 2 : used the second dataset
I found the similar titles in both of them
